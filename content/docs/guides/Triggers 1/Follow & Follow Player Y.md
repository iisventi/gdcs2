- The Follow Trigger copies one object’s movements to a group. You can use X/Y mod to multiply the X and Y movements accordingly.
- The Follow Player Y trigger sets objects’ Y positions to the player’s. You can change the speed of the objects, or how much delay they have when copying the player’s movements.

# 1: Follow Trigger

The Follow trigger copies one object’s movements to another set of objects. The Center group must be a One-Object group or a Parent Group, as usual.

X/Y mod multiplies the size of the movements.

Stacking follow triggers is complex and heavily dependent on the way you do it.

- Many groups CAN follow one group. One group CAN follow many groups.
- One object can be added to multiple follow groups, and their move effects will be additively combined.
- If two follow triggers have the same target & center groups, the second trigger activation will override the first.
- If one follow trigger’s center group is another’s target group, and vice versa, then the results will vary depending on activation order.

# 2: Follow Player Y Trigger

The Follow Player Y trigger sets object’s positions to the player’s Y position, as opposed to just copying the player’s movements. This lets it work even when the player teleports.

Speed determines how fast the objects move to the player’s Y position, in terms of the player’s speed. Max Speed is the maximum speed of the trigger’s movement, in blocks per second.

Delay adjusts how delayed the Follow Player Y’s movements are from the player’s.

Offset adjusts how far above/below the player the objects are.

You’ll notice that when multiple objects are involved in the trigger, they’ll all collapse on a single point. To counteract this, either use a Follow trigger and a One-Object group, or set a Parent Group object for the trigger.

Follow Player Y triggers stack normally, just like Move triggers do. You don't need to do anything additional to get them to stack.
