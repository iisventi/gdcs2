# 1: Features

The main Color trigger UI is the same as a color channel’s one. You have the circular wheel where you can select a color’s hue and how saturated/bright it is, and you can use Copy Color to copy and adjust the color from another color channel.

The only additional feature is the "Default" button, which resets the color to the original one for that color channel.

Blending adds colors together, while P1 and P2 colors are the player colors.
