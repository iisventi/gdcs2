## TLDR - What this guide covers
- The reset trigger resets any collectibles and checkpoints under an ID of your choosing.

** **

The example above has a checkpoint and six coin collectables assigned to group ID `1`. Touching the reset trigger resets everything under that group ID.

The Reset trigger also works on breakable blocks too.
