## Guide info
Short: 4-6 minutes

## TLDR - What this guide covers
- A set of surface-level creating choices form a style.
- There are three main genres of deco styles: classical, modern, and custom art.
- **Classical** centers around using the default in-game objects as tilemapped assets.
- **Modern** uses simple designs to give more focus to visual effects.
- **Custom Art** consists of making new custom assets using in-game objects.
- While a style is a set of surface-level creating choices, you shouldn’t focus as much on these choices until you’re closer to mastery of decoration.

# 1: Classic Design

During the pre-1.9 era, tools like free move and scale were not available for creators to use. As a result, almost all decoration was tilemapped; __snapped to the grid in neat squares__. Similarly, features like Z layers and alpha did not exist, so almost all decoration used the in-game objects as assets as opposed to shapes to make custom assets with.

This is the general definition of classic design; __levels with tilemapped decoration that use default objects as assets__. This technical limitation is visible in every Robtop level, and levels from older creators like Hinds.

# 2: Modern

Once the 2.0 update was released, it became possible to make simpler designs and rely on other things like visual effects to make levels look more interesting. This made it easier to make modern levels, which __rely more on visual effects than intricate textures to look interesting, and tend to be less heavy on details__. Works from creators like Echonox, Optical, and (more recently) Knots and Xender Game are great examples of this style.

# 3: Custom Art

With custom art, the focus is __using in-game objects to make new custom assets and art.__ While custom art has long been used for backgrounds, endscreens, and the like, only recently has it been incorporated in the foreground of the level. This is often used in a specific environment like a forest, where custom assets can play a great role. The act of decorating itself is art so we will refer to this as custom art to distinguish. You will see this done by creators like Culuc, Vulna, and me.

There are also sub-styles to each of these genres, but they are all made of derivatives of these three main things. As an example, Glow Design uses in-game glow objects to make gradients and combines it with the tilemapped nature of classical design. Modern Art combines flat colors and visual effects with the custom asset approach of custom art.

# 4: Making a Style

So how do you actually make a style? Ultimately, it is composed of many surface-level decisions you make while creating. Here are the main decisions you can make at your current level of knowledge, provided that you have read all the lessons before this.

- *Tilemapping*: Do I want to stick to the main grid, or make more freeform shapes?

**Tilemapped:** Shine (Preview) by Uriun
**Non-Tilemapped:** Culuc’s part in Abyssal Extinction

- *Assets*: Do I use in-game objects as assets, or make my own custom ones? These skills are the ones you learned in the prior deco guides; how to use objects to create custom shapes and fill them in.

**Default Assets:** Mastermind by Hinds 
**Custom Assets:** Mzero’s part in Night Rider

• *Details*: Do I rely more on intricate details and textures, or on visual effects? You'll learn how to make details and animations/visual effects in Deco 1.

**Details:** Old Valley by Vulna 
**Visual Effects:** Key by Ilrell and Swirl

- *Backgrounds*: Do I need a custom background? You'll learn how to make a custom background in Deco 1 as well.

**Custom Background:** Shards of Siberia by Xender Game 
**No Custom Background:** Fusion II by Manix648

# 5: Do Styles Matter?

While this entire guide has been on what style categories exist and how you can start making one for yourself, we strongly advise *against* focusing on styles. While styles arise from limitations, they themselves *are* a limitation and will only hurt your growth as a creator until you’ve mastered it.

**Treating your style as anything more than a surface-level thing will hurt your ability to take feedback, and it also tends to be short-term thinking.** Like you and your skills, styles grow and change. You do not need to limit yourself to one, nor should you really care at this stage.

It is helpful to know that styles exist and what they are, but do not let it get in the way of your growth. Once you have attained mastery, you will be able to answer the question “Do Styles Matter?” with far more certainty than you can now.
