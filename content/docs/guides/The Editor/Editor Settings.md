- Level Settings help you customize how your level will start.
- Due to the changing landscape of Update 2.2 compared to Update 2.1, legacy options are placed for compatibility with older levels.
- You can customize your editor experience using the Editor Settings button, on the main menu.
- If you’re playing on a PC, you can use keybinds to speed up the building process.

# 1: Level Settings
__How would you like your level to start?__ The **level settings** can help you set it up. You can access this from the :Settings: button in the top right corner of the main editor screen. Clicking on it will bring you to this page.

{{< img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1YBMfoE_jAqBhOEjB5rhqUif89PEWvR3r" >}}

## Color Options
At the top center of the page, you have options to change the color of the Background, Ground, Secondary Ground Color, Ground Line, Middle Ground, Secondary Middle Ground Color, and all color channels (in the more section). The plus symbols next to the labels will bring you back to the main editor screen and allow you to choose a color using a HSV slider.

## BG, G, and MG selectors
To the right of the screen, there are three selectors where you can choose the starting background, ground, and the middle ground of the level. If the MG selector has a cross on it, the middle ground is removed.

## Font
The font button will allow you to scroll through and select a font used in the level’s text objects. There are currently 60 fonts to choose from.

## Speed
Here you can select the starting speed of the level. There are five different speeds to choose from.

## Mode
Here you can select the starting gamemode of the level. There are eight gamemodes to choose from.

## Game Type
Game Type allows you to choose between classic mode and platformer mode for your level. Note that the wave and swing game modes are disabled for platformer mode.

## Select Song
Select the starting song for the level from the list of default songs or [use a custom song](/docs/guides/the-editor/choosing-a-song).

## Options
Gives extra options for the level, which includes the following:
- **Mini Mode**: __Shrinks the player’s size from the start of the level.__
- **Dual Mode**: __Puts the player into dual mode at the start of the level.__
- **2-Player Mode**: __Sets the level into 2-player mode, where dual icons are controlled by two different control sets.__
- **Mirror Mode**: __Sets the screen to be mirrored at the start of the level__.
- **Flip Gravity**: __Makes the player's gravity upside down at the start of the level.__
- **Rotate Gameplay**: __Rotates the gameplay at the start of the level.__
- **Reverse Gameplay**: __Makes the player go backwards from the start of the level instead of forwards.__
- **No Time Penalty**: An option that only affects platformer mode. As you play a level in platformer mode, you lose 1,000 points per second. __This option removes this point loss.__
- **Spawn Group**: __Spawns the player at the position of an object with the selected group.__ If multiple objects have the same group, one will be chosen at random. In normal mode, only the object’s y-value is relevant for spawning.

## Legacy Options
Within the options menu is another gear icon which leads to the legacy options menu. These options make it so that levels before recent updates can work like they did before the update. For the new 2.2 levels, it’s recommended to leave these options alone:
- **Allow Multi-Rotation**: __Objects that are being rotated by 2 or more different rotate triggers will rotate properly.__

{{< youtube WXTGlvQTBRg>}}

- **Enable 2.2 Changes**: __Changes progression in the level from being based on player position to being based on the verification completion time.__
- **Allow Static-Rotate**: __Makes it so that static objects can visually rotate properly.__ Hitboxes are not rotated. This only works in the editor.

{{< youtube O28Ru0-MghQ>}}

- **Enable Player Squeeze**: __Fixes a bug that allows a player to “squeeze” into an object when it shouldn’t.__

{{< youtube njNbKLisV5w>}}

- **Fix Gravity Bug**: __Fixes a bug where upside down gravity had different physics than normal gravity.__
- **Fix Negative Scale**: __Fixes a bug where scaling an object into the negatives using scale hacks would remove or massively shrink a hitbox for an object.__
- **Fix Robot Jump**: __Fixes moments where jumping at the right time on a slope or before a pad as a robot would give a massive jump height boost.__

{{< youtube Y9qBZxjDCK8>}}

- **Dynamic Level Height**: __Increases the level height as you build higher.__ This is similar to how a level’s length increases as you build further.
- **Sort Groups**: __Makes it so that spawned groups are spawned from left to right.__
- **Fix Radius Collision**: __Fixes a bug where circular hitboxes wouldn’t properly register by adding a circle hitbox to the player for those interactions.__

{{< img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1xsVBXjHq9fAaUk_h8AHatNtDXbg6f76I" >}}

- **Reverse Sync**: __Speeds up or slows down the player so that the music can stay in sync whenever a direction change occurs.__ 
- **Decrease Boost Slide**: __Lessens how much the player slides after being launched by a dash orb or moving objects.__

# 2: Editor Settings

Meanwhile, the **editor settings** can be accessed on the main editor screen by pressing the “Esc” button or by clicking the :Pause: pause button in the top right corner. They contain a slew of features that change how the editor looks, followed by some quality of life features.

{{< img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/13VOHpks5xqZxgyVU-6uJnt8KSz9ardki" >}}

## Left Screen Options
- **Show Hitboxes**: __Shows the hitboxes of objects that have them.__ Blue hitboxes are solid objects, red ones are hazards, and green ones are interactable objects. 

> Note: Some objects do not have their hitboxes shown, even though they do have one. HItboxes are removed when an object has “No Touch” enabled.

{{< img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/12eF7PgY7BdFJgxadEcOMg0vqdiD8NrPj" >}}

- **Hide Invisible**: __Makes all objects with the “Hide” option enabled invisible.__

- **Ignore Damage**: __Makes it so that you can’t die while playtesting in the editor.__

## Music Guidelines
**Music guidelines** are __lines in the editor that appear by default when using main level songs and have to be created for custom songs__. The left button at the bottom of the screen toggles the visibility of these lines.

{{< img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1hHPDt5RbGulPOBagnaHRMxSh9POGg8CS" >}}

## Right Screen Options
These settings are on the right side of the editor, to the right of buttons like "Save" and "Save and Play".

- **Create Loop**: __Quickly sets up a spawn loop for your trigger setup.__
- **Regroup**: __Assigns existing triggers the lowest next free group.__
- **Align X**: __Equally distributes selected objects horizontally.__

## Extra Settings
These settings can be found by clicking the button with a gear on it in the top right of the pause menu of the editor.
- **Draw Trigger Boxes**: __Shows the hitboxes for triggers with the “Touch Triggered” setting enabled.__
- **Playtest No UI**: __Hides most of the editor UI while playtesting.__
- **Playtest Music**: __Plays the level music while playtesting.__
- **Effect Lines**: __Shows light blue lines at the point a trigger is activated.__

- **Grid On Top**: __Overlaps the grid on top of editor objects__.
- **Playtest No Grid**: __Hides the grid while playtesting.__
- **Hide Background**: __Removes the background in the editor, leaving a black, empty one instead.__
- **Enable Link Controls**: __Allows you to link objects together, which means they will be selected and deleted together when one object in the link is selected/deleted__. Linking objects and combining it with an “Area Parent” object can allow object movement to be linked in Area triggers.

{{< youtube DN7-4_8FgA8>}}

- **Hold To Swipe**: __Enables swiping after holding down for a while.__
- **Buttons Per Row/Button Rows**: Allows you to __customize how many buttons are displayed in the build, edit, and delete tabs.__ There is a minimum of 6 columns and 2 rows, and a maximum of 12 columns and 3 rows.
- **Swipe Cycle Mode**: When using swipe, you are able to select multiple objects. However, if you try to click on an object that is with or near other objects, you might select the wrong one. Swipe Cycle __allows you to cycle between objects before you keep a selection__. Click on an object in very close proximity and within a close window of time from the last selection and it will deselect the last object and select a new object.

{{< youtube fpQ2H4lGHeo>}}

- **Layer Locking**: __Allows you to lock layers by clicking the layer number in the editor.__ Makes it so you cannot build or select objects in them. This is explained more in the [Organizing Objects](/docs/guides/the-editor/organizing-objects/#locking-editor-layers) guide.

- **Small Warp Buttons**: __Decreases the size of the warp buttons__ on an object when using the warp feature in the Edit Tab.

## Keybinds [PC-exclusive]
**Keybinds** allow you to __input certain key combinations to perform actions in the editor__. As of Update 2.205, none of these can be binded to different keys. They can be found in the pause menu of the editor or the main options menu of the game. Most are self explanatory, but these keybinds need more explaining.
- **Lock/Unlock Preview**: __Locks the visuals of the editor preview to a specific point in the editor.__

{{< youtube mftxAmNIlLQ>}}

- **Save/Load Editor Pos**: __Saves the screen position of the editor camera which can be loaded to go to later.__ You can save a position using using Ctrl+[0-9], and load it using Alt+[0-9].
