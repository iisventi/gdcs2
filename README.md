# GDCS 2.0

GDCS 2.0 (as we like to call it) is a wiki-style, community-driven version of the GDCS guides.

## Purpose

Instead of having to go through a lengthier process of contacting Guide Managers, anyone can directly suggest changes.
As this project is hosted on GitHub it only has to go through a basic approval process before being added to the wiki.

## Get Started

For now, you can modify contents in your own fork and send a pull request, or alternatively submit an issue through the appropiate means.

## Need Help?

Please contact one of our Server Admins in the Discord server, they'll be happy to help you with any issue you have!
